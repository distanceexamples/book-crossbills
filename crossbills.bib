  abstract    = {1. The ability to monitor abundance of animal populations is becoming
	increasingly important, in light of growing concerns over the loss
	of biodiversity through anthropogenic changes. A widely used tool
	for such monitoring is distance sampling, in which distances of detected
	animals from a line or point are modelled, to estimate detectability
	and hence abundance. Nevertheless, many species still prove problematic
	to survey. We have developed two extensions to point transect sampling
	that potentially allow abundance to be estimated for a number of
	species from diverse taxa for which good survey methods have not
	previously been available. 2. For each method, the primary survey
	comprises a random sample of points, or more usually a systematic
	grid of points, through the region of interest. Animals are lured
	to a point, or trapped at a point, and the number of animals observed
	at each point is recorded. A separate study is conducted on a subset
	of animals, to record whether they respond to the lure or enter the
	trap, for a range of known distances from the point. These data are
	used to estimate the probability that an animal will respond to the
	lure or enter the trap, as a function of its initial distance from
	the point. This allows the counts to be converted to an estimate
	of abundance in the survey region. 3. We illustrated the methods
	using a lure survey of crossbills Loxia spp. in coniferous woodland
	in Scotland. 4. Synthesis and applications. Two extensions of point
	transect sampling that use the same statistical methodology, lure
	point transects and trapping point transects, have been developed.
	Lure point transects extend the applicability of distance sampling
	to species that can be lured to a point, while trapping point transects
	potentially allow abundance estimation of species that can be trapped,
	with fewer resources needed than trapping webs and conventional mark-recapture
	methods. Â© 2006 British Ecological Society.},
